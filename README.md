## WIP

Simple Node application aiming to give LaunchDarkly users the ability to identify who'll be part of a percentage rollout. 

It accepts a CSV file with a single column called `email`. The output is TBD but something that shows the user who's going to be part of a particular % rollout. Can be another CSV with just the email addresses that receive `true` flag value or perhaps a CSV with the complete user set, just with added column.
